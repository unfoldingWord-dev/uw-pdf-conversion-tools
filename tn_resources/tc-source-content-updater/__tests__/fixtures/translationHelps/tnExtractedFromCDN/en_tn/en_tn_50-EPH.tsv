EPH	front	intro	e3di			0		# Introduction to Ephesians<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Ephesians<br><br>1. Greeting and prayer for the spiritual blessings in Christ (1:1-23)<br>1. Sin and salvation (2:1-10)<br>1. Unity and peace (2:11-22)<br>1. Mystery of Christ in you, made known (3:1-13)<br>1. Prayer for riches of his glory to make them strong (3:14-21)<br>1. Unity of the Spirit, building up the Body of Christ (4:1-16)<br>1. New life (4:17-32)<br>1. Imitators of God (5:1-21)<br>1. Wives and husbands; children and parents; slaves and masters (5:22-6:9)<br>1. Armor of God (6:10-20)<br>1. Final greeting (6:21-24)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Ephesians?<br><br>Paul wrote Ephesians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>The Apostle Paul helped start the church in Ephesus on one of his trips. He also lived in Ephesus for a year and a half and helped the believers there. Paul probably wrote this letter while he was in prison in Rome.<br><br>### What is the Book of Ephesians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the Christians in Ephesus to explain God's love for them in Christ Jesus. He described the blessings that God was giving them because they were now united with Christ. He explained that all believers are united together, whether Jew or Gentile. Paul also wanted to encourage them to live in a way that pleases God.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Ephesians." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's Letter to the Church in Ephesus" or "A Letter to the Christians in Ephesus." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the "hidden truth" in the Book of Ephesians?<br><br>The expression translated in the ULT as "hidden truth" or "hidden" occurs six times. By it Paul always meant something that God had to reveal to human beings because they could not know it on their own. It always referred to something about how God planned to save mankind. Sometimes it was about his plan to cause peace between himself and mankind. Sometimes it was about his plan to unite Jews and Gentiles through Christ. Gentiles are now able to benefit from the promises of Christ as equals with the Jews.<br><br>### What did Paul say about salvation and righteous living?<br><br>Paul said much about salvation and righteous living in this letter and in many of his letters. He said that God has been very kind and saved Christians because they believe in Jesus. Therefore, after they become Christians, they should live in a righteous way to show that they have faith in Christ. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural "you"<br><br>In this book, the word "I" refers to Paul. The word "you" is almost always plural and refers to the believers who may read this letter. The three exceptions to this are: 5:14, 6:2, and 6:3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### What did Paul mean by the "new self" or the "new man"?<br><br>When Paul spoke of the "new self" or the "new man," he meant the new nature that a believer receives from the Holy Spirit. This new nature was created in God's image (See: 4:24). The phrase "new man" is also used for God causing peace between Jews and Gentiles. God brought them together as one people that belong to him (See: 2:15).<br><br>### How are the ideas of "holy" and "sanctify" represented in Ephesians in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:<br><br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the use of "holy" to express the fact that God views Christians as sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another use of "holy" is to express the idea that God is perfect and faultless. A third use is to express the idea that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses "holy," "holy God," "holy ones," or "holy people." (See: 1:1, 4)<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses "believer" or "believers."<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses "set apart," "dedicated to," or "reserved for." (See: 3:5)<br><br>The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by the expression "in Christ," "in the Lord," etc.?<br><br>This kind of expression occurs in 1:1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20; 2:6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22; 3:5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 21; 4:1, 17, 21, 32; 5:8, 18, 19; 6:1, 10, 18, 21. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Ephesians?<br><br><br>* "in Ephesus" (1:1). Some early manuscripts do not include this expression, but it is probably in the original letter. The ULT, UST, and many modern versions include it.<br>* "because we are members of his body" (5:30). Most modern versions, including the ULT and UST, read in this way. Some older versions read, "because we are members of his body and of his bones." Translators might decide to choose the second reading if other versions in their area have it that way. If translators choose the second reading, they should put the additional words inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they are probably not original to the Book of Ephesians.<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
EPH	1	intro	fg42			0		# Ephesians 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>### "I pray"<br><br>Paul structures part of this chapter like a prayer of praise to God. But Paul is not just talking to God. He is teaching the church in Ephesus. He also tells the Ephesians how he is praying for them.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Predestination<br>Many scholars believe this chapter teaches on a subject known as "predestination." This is related to the biblical concept of "predestine." Some scholars take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some people to eternally save. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject. So translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]])<br>

EPH	2	intro	e7qn			0		# Ephesians 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter focuses on a Christian's life before coming to believe in Jesus. Paul then uses this information to explain how a person's former way of living is distinct from a Christian's new identity "in Christ." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### One body<br>Paul teaches about the church in this chapter. The church is made of two different groups of people (Jews and Gentiles). They are now one group or "body." The church is also known as the body of Christ. Jews and Gentiles are united in Christ.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### "Dead in trespasses and sins"<br>Paul teaches that those who are not Christians are "dead" in their sin. Sin binds or enslaves them. This makes them spiritually "dead." Paul writes that God makes Christians alive in Christ. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Descriptions of worldly living<br>Paul uses many different ways to describe how non-Christians act. They "lived according to the ways of this world" and are "living according to the ruler of the authorities of the air," "fulfilling the evil desires of our sinful nature," and "carrying out the desires of the body and of the mind."<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### "It is the gift of God"<br>Some scholars believe "it" here refers to being saved. Other scholars believe that it is faith that is the gift of God. Because of how the Greek tenses agree, "it" here more likely refers to all of being saved by God's grace through faith.<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>This is a complex issue. "Flesh" is possibly a metaphor for a person's sinful nature. The phrase "Gentiles in the flesh" indicates the Ephesians once lived without any concern for God. "Flesh" is also used in this verse to refer to the physical part of man. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])<br>
EPH	2	1	xf5s			0	Connecting Statement:	Paul reminds the believers of their past and the way they now are before God.
EPH	2	1	dxx8	figs-metaphor	ὑμᾶς ὄντας νεκροὺς τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν	1	you were dead in your trespasses and sins	This shows how sinful people are unable to obey God in the same way a dead person is unable to respond physically. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EPH	2	1	lp32	figs-doublet	τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν	1	your trespasses and sins	The words "trespasses" and "sins" have similar meanings. Paul uses them together to emphasize the greatness of the people's sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EPH	2	2	i7d4	figs-metonymy	κατὰ τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ κόσμου τούτου	1	according to the ways of this world	The apostles also used "world" to refer to the selfish behaviors and corrupt values of the people living in this world. Alternate translation: "according to the values of people living in the world" or "following the principles of this present world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EPH	2	2	n5d2		τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ ἀέρος	1	the ruler of the authorities of the air	This refers to the devil or Satan.

EPH	2	6	na2n	figs-pastforfuture	συνήγειρεν	0	God raised us up together with Christ	Here to raise up is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again. Possible meanings are 1) because God has caused Christ to come alive again, God has already given Paul and the believers in Ephesus new spiritual life. Alternate translation: "God has given us new life because we belong to Christ" or 2) because God has caused Christ to come alive again, the believers in Ephesus can know that after they die they will live with Christ, and Paul can speak of the believers living again as if it has already happened. Alternate translation: "We can be sure that God will give us life as he has caused Christ to come alive again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EPH	2	6	b499		ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις	1	in the heavenly places	"in the supernatural world." The word "heavenly" refers to the place where God is. See how this is translated in [Ephesians 1:3](../01/03.md).

EPH	5	intro	tdd2			0		# Ephesians 05 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the words of verse 14.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Inheritance of the kingdom of Christ<br>This is difficult to understand. Some scholars believe those who continue to practice these things will not inherit eternal life. But God can forgive all the sins listed in this verse. So immoral, impure, or greedy people can still receive eternal life if they repent and believe in Jesus.  A more natural reading is "No person who is sexually immoral or indecent, or who is greedy (for this is the same as worshiping idols) will be among God's people over whom Christ rules as king." (UST) (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/life]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Wives, submit to your husbands<br>Scholars are divided over how to understand this passage in its historical and cultural context. Some scholars believe men and women are perfectly equal in all things. Other scholars believe God created men and women to serve in distinctly different roles in marriage and the church. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.<br>
