Jonah tries to run away from Yahweh (1:1-2:10)<br>- Jonah disobeys Yahweh's first call to go to Nineveh (1:1–3)<br>- Jonah and the Gentile sailors (1:4–16)<br>- Yahweh provides a large fish to swallow Jonah (1:17)<br>- Jonah prays from inside the fish and is rescued (2:1–10)<br>1. Jonah in Nineveh (3:1-4:11)<br>- Yahweh again calls Jonah to go to Nineveh, and Jonah proclaims Yahweh's message (3:1–4)<br>- Nineveh repents (3:5-9)<br>- Yahweh decides not to destroy Nineveh (3:10)<br>- Jonah is very angry with Yahweh (4:1–3)<br>- Yahweh teaches Jonah about grace and mercy (4:4–11)<br><br>### What is the Book of Jonah about?<br><br>Jonah, son of Amittai, was a prophet from Gath Hepher (2 Kings 14:25). This book tells about what happened to Jonah. It tells how Yahweh shows mercy and grace to Gentiles. It also tells how the Ninevites repented and called out to Yahweh for mercy. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])<br><br>Yahweh sent Jonah to warn the people of Nineveh that he was ready to punish them. Yahweh said that if they would repent he would not harm them. However, Jonah was an Israelite and he did not want the Ninevites to repent. So Jonah tried to sail away in the opposite direction instead of doing what Yahweh told him to do. But Yahweh stopped him by sending a storm and a large fish to swallow him.<br><br>Jonah repented and warned the Ninevites. As a result, Yahweh taught him that he is concerned about all people, not just the Israelites.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>This book is traditionally titled "The Book of Jonah" or just "Jonah." Translators may decide to use a clearer title such as "The Book about Jonah." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Jonah?<br><br>Jonah was probably involved in the writing of this book. However, scholars do not know who actually wrote it.<br><br>Jonah lived in the northern kingdom of Israel. He prophesied sometime between 800 and 750 B.C. during the reign of King Jeroboam II.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the nation of Assyria?<br><br>During the time of Jonah, Assyria was the most powerful kingdom in the ancient Near East. Nineveh was the capital city of Assyria.<br><br>Assyria was cruel to its enemies. Eventually, Yahweh punished the Assyrians for the wicked things they did.<br><br>### Did Assyria convert to Judaism?<br><br>Some scholars think that the Assyrians started worshiping Yahweh alone. However, most scholars think they continued to worship other false gods. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])<br>
JON	1	intro	xvp2			0		# Jonah 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The narrative of this chapter starts abruptly. This could cause difficulty for the translator. The translator should not attempt to smooth this introduction unless absolutely necessary.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Miracle<br><br>In verse [Jonah 17](./17.md), there is the mention of "a great fish." It may be difficult to imagine a sea creature big enough to swallow a man whole and who then survives for three days and nights inside. Translators should not try to explain miraculous events in an attempt to make it easier to understand. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Situational irony<br><br>There is an ironic situation in this chapter. Jonah is a prophet of God and should endeavor to do God's will. Instead, he is running away from God. Although the Gentile sailors are not Israelites, they act out of faith and fear of Yahweh when sending Jonah to a "certain death" by throwing him overboard. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/willofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Sea<br><br>People in the ancient Near East also saw the sea as chaotic and did not trust it. Some of the gods they worshiped were gods of the sea. Jonah's people, the Hebrews, feared the sea greatly. However, Jonah's fear of Yahweh was not enough to keep him from going into a ship and sailing to get away from Yahweh. His actions are contrasted by the actions of the Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>Even though no one knows for sure where Tarshish was, the writer assumes that the reader knows that Jonah had to face away from Nineveh to go there.

JON	2	intro	ae4k			0		# Jonah 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter begins with a prayer by Jonah, and many translators have chosen to set it apart by setting its lines farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. Translators can follow this practice, but they are not obligated to.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sea<br>This chapter contains many terms from the sea.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Poetry<br>Prayers in Scripture often contain a poetic form. Poetry frequently uses metaphors to communicate something with a special meaning. For example, since Jonah was in a fish in the sea, being trapped is compared to a prison. Jonah is overwhelmed by the depth of the sea and expresses this by speaking about the at the "base of the mountains" and in the "belly of Sheol." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Repentance<br>Scholars are divided over whether Jonah's repentance was genuine or whether he was trying to save his life. In light of his attitude in chapter 4, it is uncertain if he was genuinely repentant. If possible, it is best for translators to avoid making a definitive stance on whether Jonah's repentance was genuine. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br>

JON	2	9	nfd2			0	I will sacrifice to you with a voice of thanksgiving	This means that Jonah would thank God while he offered a sacrifice to him. It is not clear whether Jonah planned to thank God by singing or shouting joyfully.

JON	3	intro	z3ut			0		# Jonah 03 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter returns to a narrative of Jonah's life.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Animals<br>According to the king's proclamation, the animals had to participate in the fast he ordered. This most likely reflects their pagan mindset. There was nothing in the law of Moses that instructed the people to have the animals participate in any religious acts. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Size of Nineveh<br>When the author talks about the size of Nineveh, the measurements he gives are confusing. The phrase "three days' journey" is ambiguous in Hebrew, as many scholars have remarked. In Jonah's day, cities were not as big as they are today. So although Nineveh was a big city, it was not as big as most modern cities.<br><br>### God repenting or relenting<br>The last verse of this chapter says, "So then God changed his mind about the punishment that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it." This concept of God changing His mind may be troubling for some translators and people may struggle to understand it. God's character is consistent. This whole book is written from a human viewpoint and so it is hard to understand the mind of God.<br><br>Yahweh is just and merciful so even though God did not follow through with a judgment in this instance, God's plan is always to punish evil. Later in history this nation did fall and was destroyed.  (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and  [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])<br>

JON	4	intro	ys57			0		# Jonah 04 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Jonah continues the narrative while bringing the book to what seems like an unusual end. This emphasizes that the book is not really about Jonah. It is about God's desire to be merciful on anyone, whether Jew or pagan. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Jonah's anger<br>It is important to see the relationship between a prophet and Yahweh. Aprophet was to prophesy for Yahweh, and his words must come true. According to the law of Moses, if that did not happen, the penalty was death. When Jonah told the city of Nineveh that it was going to be destroyed in forty days, he was certain it was going to happen. When it did not happen, Jonah was angry with God because he hated the people of Nineveh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br>As in other places, Jonah asks rhetorical questions to show how angry he was at Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>### Parallel to Mount Sinai<br>In verse 2, Jonah attributes a series of characteristics to God. A Jewish reader of this book would recognize this as a formula Moses used in speaking about God when he was meeting God on Mount Sinai.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### God's grace<br>When Jonah went outside the city, he got very hot and God graciously provided some relief through the plant. God was trying to teach Jonah through an object lesson. It is important for the reader to see this clearly. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]])<br>
