OBA	front	intro	jrz8			0		# Introduction to Obadiah<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Obadiah<br><br>1. Yahweh will judge Edom (1:1-16)<br>- Yahweh will destroy Edom (1:1–9)<br>- Why Yahweh will destroy Edom (1:10–14)<br>1. Yahweh will judge the nations (1:15–16)<br>1. Yahweh will deliver his people (1:17–21)<br><br>### What is the Book of Obadiah about?<br><br>After Babylon destroyed Jerusalem, the Edomites captured fleeing Jews. Then they gave these Jews over to Babylon. The Book of Obadiah is about Yahweh judging the Edomites for harming his people. This book would be comforting to the exiled people of Judah.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>This book is traditionally titled "The Book of Obadiah" or just "Obadiah." Translators may decide to use a clearer title such as "The Sayings of Obadiah." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Obadiah?<br><br>The prophet Obadiah probably wrote this book. We know nothing more about Obadiah. His name in Hebrew means "Servant of Yahweh."<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was Edom's relationship to Israel?<br><br>Obadiah referred to Edom as Israel's brother. This is because the Edomites descended from Esau, and the Israelites descended from Jacob. Jacob and Esau were brothers. This made Edom betraying Israel much worse.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How do I translate the concept of "pride"?<br><br>The Book of Obadiah speaks of the pride of Edom. This meant that the Edomites thought their enemies or Yahweh could not defeat them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/proud]])<br>
