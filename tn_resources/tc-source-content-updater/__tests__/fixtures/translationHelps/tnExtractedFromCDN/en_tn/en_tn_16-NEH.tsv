NEH	front	intro	k2y2			0		# Introduction to Nehemiah<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Nehemiah<br><br>1. Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem and inspects the walls (1:1-2:20)<br>1. The people rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (3:1-4:23)<br>1. Nehemiah helps the poor and provides an unselfish example (5:1–19)<br>1. Enemies try to slow down the work, but the people finish the walls (6:1–19)<br>1. Nehemiah lists the people who returned from exile (7:6–73)<br>1. Ezra reads the Law of Yahweh and the people respond (8:1-10:39)<br>1. Nehemiah lists the people who lived in and around Jerusalem (11:1–36)<br>1. Nehemiah lists the priests and Levites (12:1–26)<br>1. The people dedicate the walls of Jerusalem (12:27–47)<br>1. Nehemiah corrects problems (13:1–31)<br><br>### What is the Book of Nehemiah about?<br><br>A Jew named Nehemiah lived in Persia and worked for King Artaxerxes. Nehemiah received a report that the walls around Jerusalem were broken down. Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem to help rebuild the city walls. The walls around the city helped protect the city against armies and invaders.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>The Book of Nehemiah is named for a Jewish leader named Nehemiah. Translators can use the traditional title "Nehemiah." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The Book about Nehemiah." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations?<br><br>Foreigners worshiped many false gods. Yahweh did not allow his people to marry foreigners. He knew this would cause the people of Israel to worship false gods. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])<br><br>### Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland?<br><br>Many of the Jews remained in Babylon instead of returning to the Promised Land. Many of them were successful in Babylon and desired to remain there. However, this meant that they were unable to worship Yahweh in Jerusalem as their ancestors had done. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How does the Book of Nehemiah use the term "Israel"?<br><br>The Book of Nehemiah uses the term "Israel" to refer to the kingdom of Judah. It was mostly made up of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The other ten tribes had ended their loyalty to any kings descended from David. God allowed the Assyrians to conquer the other ten tribes and take them into exile. As a result, they mixed with other people groups and did not return to the land of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])<br><br>### Are the events in the Book of Nehemiah told in the order that they actually happened?<br><br>Some of the events in the Book of Nehemiah are not told in the order they actually happened. Translators should pay attention to notes that signal when events are probably out of order.<br>
NEH	1	intro	y5jf			0		# Nehemiah 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>### "The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:"<br>This phrase serves as an introduction to this entire book.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Repentance<br>This chapter is a single long record of Nehemiah's repentance on behalf of the people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### I<br>While the author of this book is probably Ezra, the word "I" always refers to Nehemiah.<br><br>### Israel<br>It is uncertain to whom "Israel" refers. It probably does not refer to the northern kingdom of Israel. Neither does it likely refer to the twelve tribes of Israel. Instead, it is probably a reference to Israel in the sense of the surviving people group. At Nehemiah's time, this people group exclusively comprised the tribe of Judah because the other tribes had already been scattered throughout the entire Near East, where they lost their identity, for the most part.<br>

Many scholars believe these chapters teach valuable lessons on leadership ([Nehemiah 2-6](./01.md)).<br><br>### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Nehemiah's character<br>Apparently, Nehemiah's character made an impression on the king. It was very unusual for a king to be so concerned with one of his servants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Cultural Customs<br>In ancient Persia, they thought it was important for their conquered peoples to practice their own cultural customs. It was thought that this independence promoted peace in their vast kingdom. The rebuilding of Jerusalem may have been seen as a way to allow for the Jewish cultural practices.<br><br>### Yahweh's control<br>Yahweh is seen as very powerful.
