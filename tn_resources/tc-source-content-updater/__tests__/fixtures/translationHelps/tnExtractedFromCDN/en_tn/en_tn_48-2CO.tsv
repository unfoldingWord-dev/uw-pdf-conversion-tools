2CO	front	intro	ur4j			0		# Introduction to 2 Corinthians<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of 2 Corinthians<br><br>1. Paul thanks God for the Corinthian Christians (1:1-11)<br>1. Paul explains his conduct and his ministry (1:12-7:16)<br>1. Paul speaks about contributing money for the Jerusalem church (8:1-9:15)<br>1. Paul defends his authority as an apostle (10:1-13:10)<br>1. Paul gives final greetings and encouragement (13:11-14)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of 2 Corinthians?<br><br>Paul was the author. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul started the church in Corinth. He was staying in the city of Ephesus when he wrote this letter.<br><br>### What is the Book of 2 Corinthians about?<br><br>In 2 Corinthians, Paul continued to write about the conflicts among the Christians in the city of Corinth. It is clear in this letter that the Corinthians had obeyed his previous instructions to them. In 2 Corinthians, Paul encouraged them to live in a way that would please God.<br><br>Paul also wrote to assure them that Jesus Christ sent him as an apostle to preach the Gospel. Paul wanted them to understand this, because a group of Jewish Christians opposed what he was doing. They claimed Paul was not sent by God and he was teaching a false message. This group of Jewish Christians wanted Gentile Christians to obey the law of Moses.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Second Corinthians." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's Second Letter to the Church in Corinth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the city of Corinth like?<br><br>Corinth was a major city located in ancient Greece. Because it was near the Mediterranean Sea, many travelers and traders came to buy and sell goods there. This resulted in the city having people from many different cultures. The city was famous for having people who lived in immoral ways. The people worshipped Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. As part of the ceremonies honoring Aphrodite, her worshipers had sexual intercourse with temple prostitutes.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by "false apostles" (11:13)?<br><br>These were Jewish Christians. They taught that Gentile Christians had to obey the law of Moses in order to follow Christ. Christian leaders had met in Jerusalem and decided on the matter (See: Acts 15). However, it is clear that there were still some groups that disagreed with what the leaders in Jerusalem decided.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural "you"<br><br>In this book, the word "I" refers to Paul. Also, the word "you" is almost always plural and refers to the believers in Corinth. There are two exceptions to this: 6:2 and 12:9. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### How are the ideas of "holy" and "sanctify" represented in 2 Corinthians in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:<br><br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses "holy," "holy God," "holy ones," or "holy people."<br><br>* The meaning in most passages in 2 Corinthians is a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses "believer" or "believers." (See: 1:1; 8:4; 9:1, 12; 13:13)<br><br>* Sometimes the meaning in the passage implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses "set apart," "dedicated to," "reserved for," or "sanctified."<br><br>The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by expressions like "in Christ" and "in the Lord"?<br><br>This kind of expression occurs in 1:19, 20; 2:12, 17; 3:14; 5:17, 19, 21; 10:17; 12:2, 19; and 13:4. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. At the same time, he often intended other meanings as well. See, for example, "A door was opened for me in the Lord," (2:12) where Paul specifically meant that a door was opened for Paul by the Lord.<br><br>Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What does it mean to be a "new creation" in Christ (5:17)?<br><br>Paul's message was that God makes Christians part of a "new world" when a person believes in Christ. God gives a new world of holiness, peace, and joy. In this new world, believers have a new nature that has been given them by the Holy Spirit. Translators should try to express this idea.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Corinthians?<br><br>* "and in your love for us" (8:7). Many versions, including the ULT and UST, read this way. However, many other versions read, "and in our love for you." There is strong evidence that each reading is original. Translators should probably follow the reading preferred by other versions in their region.<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
2CO	1	intro	tsh3			0		# 2 Corinthians 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The first paragraph reflects a common way to begin a letter in the ancient Near East.<br><br>## Special Concepts<br><br>### Paul's integrity<br>People were criticizing Paul and saying he was not sincere. He refutes them by explaining his motives for what he was doing.<br><br>### Comfort<br>Comfort is a major theme of this chapter. The Holy Spirit comforts Christians. The Corinthians probably were afflicted and needed to be comforted.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical question<br><br>Paul uses two rhetorical questions to defend himself against a charge of not being sincere. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### We<br>Paul uses the pronoun "we". This likely represents at least Timothy and himself. It may also include other people.<br><br>### Guarantee<br><br>Paul says the Holy Spirit is the guarantee, which means pledge or down-payment, of a Christian's eternal life. Christians are securely saved. But they will not experience all of God's given promises until after they die. The Holy Spirit is a personal guarantee that this will happen. This idea comes from a business term. A person gives some valuable item to another person as a "guarantee" that they will repay money. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br>

2CO	5	intro	s14p			0		# 2 Corinthians 05 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### New bodies in heaven<br>Paul knows that when he dies he will receive a much better body. Because of this, he is not afraid of being killed for preaching the gospel. So he tells others that they too can be reconciled to God. Christ will take away their sin and give them his righteousness. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reconcile]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### New creation<br><br>The old and new creation probably refers to how Paul illustrates the old and new self. These concepts are also the same as the old and new man. The term "old" probably does not refer to the sinful nature with which a person is born. It refers to the old way of living or the Christian formerly being bound to sin. The "new creation" is the new nature or new life that God gives a person after they come to believe in Christ. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Home<br>The Christian's home is no longer in the world. A Christian's real home is in heaven. By using this metaphor, Paul emphasizes that the Christian's circumstances in this world are temporary. It gives hope to those who are suffering.

They taught things about Jesus and the gospel that were different and not true. Unlike these false teachers, Paul sacrificially served the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]])<br><br>### Light<br>Light is commonly used in the New Testament as a metaphor. Paul here uses light to indicate the revealing of God and his righteousness. Darkness describes sin. Sin seeks to remain hidden from God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/light]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/darkness]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Paul begins this chapter with an extended metaphor. He compares himself to the father of a bride who is giving a pure, virgin bride to her bridegroom. Wedding practices change depending on the cultural background. But the idea of helping to present someone as a grown and holy child is explicitly pictured in this passage. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Irony<br><br>This chapter is full of irony. Paul is hoping to shame the Corinthian believers with his irony.<br><br>"You tolerate these things well enough!" Paul thinks that they should not tolerate the way the false apostles treated them. Paul does not think they are really apostles at all.<br><br>The statement, "For you gladly put up with fools. You are wise yourselves!" means that the Corinthian believers think they were very wise but Paul does not agree.<br><br>"I will say to our shame that we were too weak to do that." Paul is speaking about behavior he thinks is very wrong in order to avoid it. He is speaking as if he thinks he is wrong for not doing it. He uses a rhetorical question also as irony. "Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/apostle]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>In refuting the false apostles claiming to be superior, Paul uses a series of rhetorical questions. Each question is coupled with an answer: "Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as though I were out of my mind.) I am more."<br><br>He also uses a series of rhetorical questions to empathize with his converts: "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who has caused another to fall into sin, and I do not burn within?"<br><br>### "Are they servants of Christ?"<br>This is sarcasm, a special type of irony used to mock or insult. Paul does not believe these false teachers actually serve Christ, only that they pretend to do so.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A "paradox" is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This sentence in verse 30 is a paradox: "If I must boast, I will boast about what shows my weaknesses." Paul does not explain why he would boast in his weakness until 2 Corinthians 12:9.

2CO	12	intro	abcf			0		# 2 Corinthians 12 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul continues defending his authority in this chapter.<br><br>When Paul was with the Corinthians, he proved himself to be an apostle by his powerful deeds. He had not ever taken anything from them. Now that he is coming for the third time, he will still not take anything. He hopes that when he visits, he will not need to be harsh with them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/apostle]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Paul's vision<br><br>Paul now defends his authority by telling about a wonderful vision of heaven. Although he speaks in the third person in verses 2-5, verse 7 indicates that he was the person who experienced the vision. It was so great, God gave him a physical handicap to keep him humble. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])<br><br>### Third heaven<br>Many scholars believe the "third" heaven is the dwelling place of God. This is because Scripture also uses "heaven" to refer to the sky (the "first" heaven) and the universe (the "second" heaven).<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>Paul uses many rhetorical questions as he defends himself against his enemies who accused him: "For how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that I was not a burden to you?" "Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same way? Did we not walk in the same steps?" and "Do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>### Sarcasm<br><br>Paul uses sarcasm, a special type of irony, when he reminds them how he had helped them at no cost. He says, "Forgive me for this wrong!" He also uses regular irony when he says: "But, since I am so crafty, I am the one who caught you by deceit." He uses it to introduce his defense against this accusation by showing how impossible it was to be true. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A "paradox" is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This sentence in verse 5 is a paradox: "I will not boast, except about my weaknesses." Most people do not boast about being weak. This sentence in verse 10 is also a paradox: "For whenever I am weak, then I am strong." In verse 9, Paul explains why both of these statements are true. ([2 Corinthians 12:5](./05.md))<br>

2CO	13	intro	abcg			0		# 2 Corinthians 13 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In this chapter, Paul finishes defending his authority. He then concludes the letter with a final greeting and blessing.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Preparation<br>Paul instructs the Corinthians as he prepares to visit them. He is hoping to avoid needing to discipline anyone in the church so he can visit them joyfully. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br>### Power and weakness<br>Paul repeatedly uses the contrasting words "power" and "weakness" in this chapter. The translator should use words that are understood to be opposites of each other.<br><br>### "Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Test yourselves."<br>Scholars are divided over what these sentences mean. Some scholars say that Christians are to test themselves to see whether their actions align with their Christian faith. The context favors this understanding. Others say these sentences mean that Christians should look at their actions and question whether they are genuinely saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br>
