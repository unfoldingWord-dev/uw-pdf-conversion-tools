### Authority Level 1: Affirmation by Translation Team

The intent of this level is to affirm the agreement of the translation team with standard Christian doctrine, as well as with the guidelines for ensuring the accuracy of the translation itself. Content published at this level promotes the broadest reach of the content as an active project, with an open invitation (implied or direct) to members of the language community to suggest improvements to the translation.

To achieve this level, the translation team asserts that the [Statement of Faith](../../intro/statement-of-faith/01.md) is an accurate reflection of their own beliefs and that the translated content is also in harmony with it.

The translator (or team) asserts that the translation has been done in accordance with the [Translation Guidelines](../../intro/translation-guidelines/01.md) and that they have made use of available exegetical and translation checking resources in the translation process, including the translationNotes and translationWords.
